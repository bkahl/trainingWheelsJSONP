Training Wheels JSONP

This is a JSONP example I did for a help menu dropdown which consisted of Videos while working for Eloqua.

I pointed the JSON file to my personal server @ kahlcor.com to test the JSONP code.

If it works properly, it should loop through the JSON file alerting all of the Objects.
